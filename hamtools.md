title: Ham's Useful Websites
---

- Before operation
  - [Windy](https://www.windy.com/): Weather forecast maps. Do not use antenna during thunder storm.
  - [HF Propagation and Solar-Terrestrial Data](https://www.hamqsl.com/solar.html): Looking for HF and 6m band propagation. But sometimes DX is not available is not caused by geomagnetic storm but due to poor antenna, environmental electromagnetic noise (EV charger besides) and QRP transmitters lol.
- During operation
  - [PSK Reporter](https://www.pskreporter.info/): Digital mode reporter site. Can be used to monitor how many HAM radio stations receive my, or other stations' digital signals, such as CW, FT8, etc. For Chinese mainland HAMs, not only Google service, but also a bootstrap CDN source (using for some theme) should be VPNed or changed. Change hosts file could be useful. I will upload the method in this site later. 
  - [Reverse Beacon Network](https://www.reversebeacon.net/): CW reporter site. Can be used to monitor how many HAM radio stations receive my, or other stations' CW signals.
  - [Contest Calendar](https://www.contestcalendar.com/): List of HAM radio contests.
  - [DX Summit](http://www.dxsummit.fi/): DX reporter site. When rare DX station is spotted, information could be uploaded to this site.
  - [QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/): An useful online HAM database. Providing a web page for each HAM in this site, and we can find some information about the callsign we search for. However, Whether the information is available depends on HAMs themselves, some HAMs didn't registered in QRZ.com and some registered but didn't put a word in it. There is also a [国区特供 QRZ.cn](http://www.qrz.cn/) in and for Chinese but I don't want to use it.
- After operation
  - [Logbook of the World](https://lotw.arrl.org/): ARRL's official logbook. //Register guide will be updated later.
  - [QRZ.com](https://www.qrz.com/): QRZ.com is not only a database but also an useful online logbook. //Register guide will be updated later.
  - [eQSL.cc](https://www.eqsl.cc/): An useful online logbook with shitty GUI.
- HAM Mapper
  - [Maidenhead Grid Locator](https://www.f5len.org/tools/locator/): Maidenhead grid mapper. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is used for this site, so this site is not available for Chinese mainland HAMs. [梅登黑德网格定位系统](http://sjzham.cn/grid/) can be used in Chinese mainland.
  - [Great Circle Mapper](https://ns6t.net/azimuth/azimuth.html): To generate a great circle map for my directional antennas.
  - [GridTraker](https://gridtracker.org/): Mapper used together with FT8 software such as [WSJT-X](https://wsjt.sourceforge.io/wsjtx.html), [JTDX](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtdx/), [JTDX 国区特供版](https://forum.hamcq.cn/d/318), etc.
- HAM DIY
  - [LC Filter Design Tool](https://markimicrowave.com/technical-resources/tools/lc-filter-design-tool/): Helpful tools to design LC filters. Maybe VPN should be used for Chinese mainland HAMs due to some google servises are used in this site.
  - [DK7ZB Antennas](https://www.qsl.net/dk7zb/start1.htm): Many useful antenna schematic diagrams in this site. I made some UV yagis using diagrams in this site, and made a lot QSO via satellites using these UV antennas. 
  - [YO3DAC Homebrew RF Circuit Design Ideas](https://www.qsl.net/va3iul/Homebrew_RF_Circuit_Design_Ideas/Homebrew_RF_Circuit_Design_Ideas.htm): Some circuit diagrams for various HAM radio equipments. Using for reference.
